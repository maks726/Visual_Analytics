# Visual_Analytics
Project from Visual Analytics cource assignment
Part1 - In this part, I am going to customize settings of ‘html_output’ and ‘pdf_output’ sections of YAML
preamble of _HomeExam30_CandNo.Rmd template file to add a personal flavor and compile the document into
popular output formats (e.g., ‘html_output’, ‘pdf_output’ and ‘slidy_presentation’) with a use of ‘Knit’
command.  
Part2 - In this part, I am going to demonstrate skills to present data in a visual form with ggplot2 library.
